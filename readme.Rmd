## Random Forest Model

The model was using Random Forest and taking the following columns as inputs to predict the column `classe`.

`accel_forearm_x`
`accel_forearm_y`
`accel_forearm_z`
`accel_arm_x`
`accel_arm_y`
`accel_arm_z`
`accel_belt_x`
`accel_belt_y`
`accel_belt_z`
`accel_dumbbell_x`
`accel_dumbbell_y`
`accel_dumbbell_z`

## Cross Validation

Using the 75% as training set and the rest 25% will be testing set
```
inTrain = createDataPartition(train_data$classe, p = 3/4)[[1]]
training = train_data[inTrain,]
testing = train_data[-inTrain,]
```
